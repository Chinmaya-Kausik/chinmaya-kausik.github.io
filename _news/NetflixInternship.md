I have started a Machine Learning Research Internship in the Machine Learning and Inference Research (MLIR) team at Netflix, under Nathan Kallus and Adith Swaminathan! I will be focusing on post-training LLM agents to handle long contexts. I'm excited to see how far we can push the envelope on LLM agents in this internship!
