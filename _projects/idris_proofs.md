### Introduction
* Formal theorem proving is a field of rising interest in mathematics where one "codes up" mathematical proofs and chains of reasoning in order to formalize them and get them verified by a computer. This is to avoid various plausible sounding but incorrect arguments from leaking into human-made proofs.
* This also serves the alternate purpose of moving towards automating theorem proving and mathematical reasoning by providing a structured framework for reasoning that can be used to train robust automated mathematical reasoning systems.

### What I did
* Implemented proofs of various mathematical results in Idris (a dependently typed language), for the Logic, Types and Spaces course at IISc.
* This involved programming in a dependently typed language.
* Most of the proofs involved algebraic results, since many students were new to working with formal verification of proofs, and analytic and topological results are usually more complex to deal with.
