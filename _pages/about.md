Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a 3rd year mathematics Ph.D. candidate at UMich working on sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning. I am being co-advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) and [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/faculty/martinjs.html).

Check out my [papers](Papers), [projects](Projects), and [personal interests](Personal)!

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What do I care about, academically? </b> </summary>
  
  * Tackling tangible, real-world questions with a principled mathematical approach. These days, my work focuses on sequential decision making under various settings - offline-to-online transfer, partial observability/latent information and non-standard feedback and reward models. I also have side projects in deep learning. On the other hand, a lot of my undergraduate background was in geometry, topology and dynamics, with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry. 
  * Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up. I have started the Stats, Physics, Astronomy, Math (SPAM) graduate student social initiative at the University of Michigan. I also co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org). I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What am I doing these days? </b></summary>
  
  * Interning at Microsoft in the advertiser optimization team under Ajith Moparthi, working on bidding algorithms and value maximization!
  * Collaborating with Yonathan Efroni (Meta), Aadirupa Saha (Apple), Nadav Merlis (ENSEA) on algorithms for bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms with feedback at varying costs and accuracies, also called multi-fidelity feedback.
  * Thinking about principled approaches to data collection and learning for RLHF under real-world considerations.
  * Formulating problems in learning under latent information and nonstationarity in bandits.
  * Organizing an interdepartmental social initiative, SPAM (Statistics, Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics).
  * Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like Monsoon Math.

  _primary goals_
  * Complete an empirical study of RLHF methods on LLMs of varying size and understand the implementation nuances of major RLHF methods.
  * Work on a large scale applied recommender systems project using the latent bandit algorithms that I designed (LOCAL-UCB and ProBALL-UCB).
  * Applying ideas from RLHF and bandits to mental health studies that my advisor is involved in.

  _side-quests_
  * Design a codenames bot using one LLM and train it againts players designed using a different LLM.
  * Explore the nuances of implementing various RL algorithms in simulated motion settings.
  * Design meaningful experiments to compare LLM agents trained using language feedback with RL agents trained using numerical feedback, using benchmark frameworks like LLF-bench.
